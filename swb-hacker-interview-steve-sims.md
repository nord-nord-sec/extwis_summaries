- Social engineering and phishing scams often target vulnerable populations.
- Proprietary encryption often fails without public scrutiny and expert testing.
- Patch management is crucial to protect systems against newly discovered vulnerabilities.
- Multiactor authentication can be bypassed with simple techniques and tools.
- Open-source libraries can introduce vulnerabilities that affect multiple applications.
- Exploit mitigations in systems create a layered defense against potential attacks.
- Doxing and extortion are common tactics used in cybercriminal activities.
- The dark web allows for anonymity, complicating law enforcement efforts.
- Trust and operational security are key in maintaining dark web activities.
- People in less economically stable regions may turn to cybercrime for financial gain.

## INSIGHTS

- Hacking's original intent was creative problem-solving, now overshadowed by negative connotations.
- As security strengthens, hackers pivot to social engineering and exploiting human vulnerabilities.
- Cybersecurity offers varied paths, from AI to malware forensics, each with unique challenges.
- Dark web activities persist through trust, privacy tools, and operational security measures.
- Commoditized hacking tools lower entry barriers, making cybercrime more accessible.
- Steganography illustrates creative misuse of technology for concealing illicit activities.
- Exploit markets' value reflects the constant cat-and-mouse game between hackers and defenders.
- Ethical hacking involves understanding adversarial tactics to better defend against them.
- Vulnerability research evolves with technology, demanding continuous adaptation and learning.
- Human error remains a significant risk factor in cybersecurity, despite technological advances.
