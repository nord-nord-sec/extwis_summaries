- Sharing Docker containers means sharing both code and environment, unlike traditional methods.
- Docker virtualizes the operating system, making it lighter and faster than VMs.
- Multi-stage Docker builds create slim images by including only necessary components.
- Docker Compose simplifies management of multiple containers and their networking.
- Docker Build Cloud significantly reduces build times by using powerful cloud servers.
- Docker Scout identifies security issues and outdated packages in container images.
- Docker containers can be run anywhere, from local machines to the cloud.
- Docker's lightweight approach makes it suitable for modern development workflows.
- Docker Compose handles networking and startup order for containers automatically.
- Docker images are snapshots of everything needed to run an application.
- Docker tools provide security, speed, and efficiency for containerized applications.
- Docker's approach reduces hardware requirements compared to virtual machines.
- Docker simplifies the setup of complex application environments with multiple services.
- Docker's shared OS kernel allows containers to be lighter and faster than VMs.
- Docker Build Cloud pushes build tasks to cloud servers for improved performance.
- Multi-stage builds in Docker enhance efficiency by separating development stages.

## QUOTES:
- "Think of containers like perfectly packaged applications."
- "Docker does things differently though instead of virtualizing everything it only virtualizes the operating system."
- "Lighter and faster I mean that’s kind of what we want right now."
- "Docker file as the recipe right you have a recipe to make a meal."
- "Docker Compose is tying them together or I should say that more technically."
- "Docker Build Cloud which will drastically decrease the amount of time it takes to build."
- "Docker orchestrates everything with our Docker Compose."
- "Docker Build Cloud pushed all of that stuff up to well Cloud servers."
- "Designed to identify security issues outdated packages and potential compliance problems within container images."
- "Docker Scout surfaces dependency vulnerability so you’re protected."
- "Docker containers can be run anywhere your machine my machine in the cloud wherever."
- "Docker build Cloud it also doesn’t just speed things up it also does all of this stuff."
- "Docker’s shared OS kernel allows containers to be lighter and faster than VMs."
- "If Docker can help you in your anywhere in your software development life cycle."
- "I highly recommend recommend learning at least bass Docker understanding Docker files into images into containers."
