# IDEAS
- Container ships built in 2023 can carry 23,000 containers, powered by massive diesel engines.
- Modern container ships are operated by about 23 people, despite their enormous size.
- Ships' navigation systems use electronic sea charts updated weekly to ensure accuracy.
- Dynamic positioning systems keep drilling ships stable without anchors in deep waters.
- Ships' propulsion systems are directly connected to the propeller without a gearbox.
- Drilling ships can drill up to 12 km deep, including horizontally, following formations.
- Ships have auxiliary diesel engines for electricity generation when the main engine is off.
- Systems like fire and gas detection are critical on drilling ships to prevent disasters.
- Blowout preventers on drilling ships can close the well in emergencies, cutting drill strings.
- The NotPetya attack in 2017 severely disrupted global supply chains, affecting shipping companies.
- Most industrial control systems use outdated protocols, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks.
- Ships' control systems often run on unsupported software like Windows 7.
- Increased internet access on ships via low earth orbit satellites increases cyber risks.
- Standards like IEC 62443 define security levels for industrial control systems.
- Hardware redundancy does not mitigate software vulnerabilities in control systems.
- Ships' systems are increasingly interconnected, reducing isolation and increasing vulnerabilities.
- Cybersecurity risk assessments and segmentation into zones and conduits are essential.
- Testing of ships' systems is difficult due to operational risks and the need for comprehensive testing.
- The maritime industry is hesitant to publicize cyber attacks, aiding attackers.
- Remote support capabilities on ships can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
- Some companies are improving their cybersecurity posture, though complexity increases risks.
- The IMO made cybersecurity mandatory for shipping companies since last year.
- Classification societies require stronger cybersecurity defenses on new ships from mid-2023.
- Insurance companies have not yet diversified premiums based on cybersecurity levels.
- The maritime industry faces significant supply chain risks from cyber attacks on major players.
- Standards and regulations are evolving to address cybersecurity in the maritime industry.
- Physical maintenance of ships is generally well-regulated and enforced by law.
- Updating connected systems on ships is critical due to evolving cyber threats.

# INSIGHTS
- Ships' propulsion systems lack gearboxes, making them simpler but vulnerable to power loss.
- Dynamic positioning uses GPS and acoustic signals to keep deep-water drilling ships stable.
- Outdated software on new ships poses significant cybersecurity risks, highlighting industry challenges.
- NotPetya's collateral damage illustrates the interconnected vulnerabilities of global supply chains.
- Segmentation and zoning in cybersecurity can help control data flow and mitigate risks.
- Redundancy in hardware does not address the simultaneous failure risk inherent in software vulnerabilities.
- Increased internet connectivity on ships enhances operational efficiency but also cyber risks.
- The maritime industry's fragmented nature creates disparities in cybersecurity capabilities.
- Comprehensive testing of ships' systems is challenging due to operational and safety constraints.
- Cybersecurity in the maritime industry requires a combination of regulatory enforcement and proactive company measures.
