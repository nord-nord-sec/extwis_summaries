# IDEAS:
- New techniques often leave people wondering how they were previously overlooked.
- Matan Bersan is a 16-year-old hacker who won over $150,000 in bounties.
- Self-access bugs can be exploited and turned into one-click ATOs.
- Self-access allows running JavaScript code in the application's origin.
- Logging the victim into the attacker's account is crucial for exploitation.
- Sensitive information pages are prime targets for exploitation.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is used to log victims into attacker accounts.
- The browser's same-origin policy treats different windows as the same site.
- Attackers can access properties of windows opened in the same origin.
- Leaking information from a page is easier than modifying it.
- Cookies can be set with specific paths to control where they are sent.
- Servers usually respect the first cookie sent by the browser.
- The cookie jar overflow technique clears all cookies by setting many cookies.
- HTTP-only cookies can be overridden using the cookie jar overflow technique.
- Redirect cookies can be exploited to redirect victims after logging in.
- The attack involves multiple stages, including waiting for victims to log in.
- Exploiting self-access bugs can lead to significant impacts on applications.
- The technique could be used to modify HTTP-only cookies.
- The exploit involves fragmented stages, making it harder to detect.
- The attack relies on the victim's regular use of the application.

# INSIGHTS:
- New techniques often leave us questioning our prior oversight.
- Self-access bugs allow for executing malicious JavaScript in an app's origin.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is crucial for logging victims into attacker accounts.
- The browser's same-origin policy enables access to properties of different windows.
- The cookie jar overflow technique is used to clear cookies by setting many cookies.
- HTTP-only cookies can be overridden with the cookie jar overflow method.
- Redirect cookies can be exploited to redirect victims after logging in.
- Fragmented attack stages make the exploit harder to detect.
- Regular application use by victims is essential for successful exploitation.
- Exploiting self-access bugs can significantly impact application integrity.
