# IDEAS

- SSRF vulnerability exploited in GitLab's analytic dashboards led to critical security impact.
- Bug was discovered in a new functionality called analytic dashboards.
- Configuration involved setting a URL as a third-party website.
- Multiple URLs within a Kubernetes cluster were vulnerable to SSRF.
- Only one URL allowed full read, returning errors and payloads.
- Impact demonstrated by accessing internal and production infrastructure.
- Past critical SSRF in Grafana hardened GitLab's infrastructure.
- Severity rated similarly for both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances.
- GitLab's local or Docker installation exposes multiple services.
- Redis exporter in GitLab can leak keys and values from Redis.
- Redis exporter works with Unix sockets, not just IP addresses.
- GitLab runner tokens stored in Redis could be exploited.
- Runner tokens enable impersonation and execution of jobs.
- Exploiting runner tokens can lead to remote code execution.
- Discovering the vulnerability required extensive testing and code review.
- Allow local requests flag in HTTP requests led to SSRF discovery.
- Vulnerability allowed regular users to configure malicious URLs.
- GitLab's self-registration policy impacted vulnerability severity rating.
- SSRF exploited through GitLab's runner registration process.
- GitLab warned about runner token secrecy in documentation.
- Redis logs monitored to identify sensitive information leakage.
- Exploitation complexity involved matching IPs with CSRF tokens.
- GitLab's scope policy treated SSRF vulnerabilities with specific edge cases.
- Runner tokens could potentially access sensitive source code.
- Exploit demonstrated the importance of thorough code review.
- Previous SSRF incidents informed GitLab's security measures.
- Redis's low-level TCP language used in SSRF exploitation.
- GitLab's runner jobs can access, build, and deploy code.
- Redis exporter provides metadata and statistics for Prometheus.
- GitLab's SSRF vulnerability highlighted the need for robust security.
- SSRF vulnerability exploitation required no privilege escalation.

# INSIGHTS

- SSRF vulnerabilities can lead to critical security impacts if not mitigated.
- Thorough code review is essential for identifying potential security flaws.
- Runner tokens can be highly sensitive and require stringent protection.
- Redis's low-level language can be exploited for malicious purposes.
- GitLab's infrastructure requires constant monitoring and hardening.
- SSRF vulnerabilities can escalate to remote code execution.
- Security measures must consider both internal and external threats.
- Regular users can exploit vulnerabilities if security is not robust.
- Documentation should emphasize the importance of token secrecy.
- Monitoring logs is crucial for detecting sensitive data leaks.

# QUOTES

- "Itâ€™s not the typical full read SSRF where you just read the metadata."
- "Bug was in a fairly new functionality, they called it analytic dashboards."
- "You configure this as an administrator on the platform."
- "All of these were in different ways, suspect to SSRF."
- "You could actually get the error back."
- "They just sent you back whatever the JSON parsing did."
- "I could get a full read both on my internal or like my self-hosted instance."
- "They have hardened it quite a lot since then."
- "You can get the highest bounty, both for the self-hosted and the com one."
- "I started to look at different services that are running inside GitLab."
- "I could point to this Redis instance and get keys and values back."
- "Redis exporter has a path that is called slash scrape."
- "You can give it a URL as a query parameter."
- "Redis exporter also could work with Unix sockets."
- "You can search for different keys in the Redis instance."
- "They say this token is supposed to be secret."
- "In the context of GitLab, these are running on separate servers called the runners."
- "Runner authenticates using the token."
- "You could get a list of all the runner tokens on the instance."
- "This creates in the end, RCE in all of the runner jobs on GitLab."
- "I also tried to read all of the old SSRF reports I could find from GitLab."
- "They always treat if you need an account, it will be low."
- "Exploiting this more, I just thought about different things and tested out."
- "They had put in the flag, allow local requests."
- "This is the best thing."
